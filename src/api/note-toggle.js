Unnote part of note, splitting the rest of the original note into new notes.

Example
-------
Text within a note has been selected:

  <p>Asked me questions about the vessel<gu-note>|, the time she left Marseilles|, the
  course she had taken,</gu-note> and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not
  been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her.</p>


We find the entire note and, within the note, we note everything _but_ what we want to unnote:

  <p>Asked me questions about the vessel<gu-note>, the time she left Marseilles<gu-note>, the
  course she had taken,</gu-note></gu-note> and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not
  been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her.</p>


Then we unwrap the previously existing note. The text we selected has been unnoted:

  <p>Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles<gu-note>, the
  course she had taken,</gu-note> and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not
  been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her.</p>

/*
  Example. We have two notes:
  <p>
    <gu-note>Some noted text</gu-note>| and some other text inbetween |<gu-note>More noted text</gu-note>
  </p>

  We press BACKSPACE, deleting the text, and end up with:
  <p>
    <gu-note data-note-edited-by="Edmond DantÃ¨s" data-note-edited-date="2014-09-15T16:49:20.012Z">Some noted text</gu-note><gu-note data-note-edited-by="Lord Wilmore" data-note-edited-date="2014-09-20T10:00:00.012Z">More noted text</gu-note>
  </p>

  This function will merge the notes:
  <p>
    <gu-note data-note-edited-by="The Count of Monte Cristo" data-note-edited-date="2014-10-10T17:00:00.012Z">Some noted text</gu-note><gu-note data-note-edited-by="The Count of Monte Cristo" data-note-edited-date="2014-10-10T17:00:00.012Z">More noted text</gu-note>
  </p>

  The last user to edit "wins", the rationale being that they have approved
  these notes by merging them. In this case all note segments are now
  listed as being edited by The Count of Monte Cristo and the timestamp
  shows the time when the notes were merged.
